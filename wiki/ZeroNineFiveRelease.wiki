At a high level, this version includes:

 * HTML reports
  * Just pass in the -html flag via the command line or specify the reporting format as html via the Ant/Maven task
 * Enhanced exception reporting
  * easyb offers two options:
   * -e for a full exception stack trace
   * -ef for exception stack trace filtering — that is, a lot of the noise associated with a Groovy exception stack is filtered out
 * Support for ignoring scenarios
  * ignore is a hip keyword now in stories and it can take as an argument a scenario name, a list of scenario names, and even a regular expression
 * Pretty printing
  * Pass in the -prettyprint flag and the output will be nicely colored, baby!
 * Narratives support non underscores
  * as_a can alternately be written as as a along with i want and so that
 * Numerous API improvements along with bug fixes!
  * For instance, the ensureThrows takes a list of exceptions now
