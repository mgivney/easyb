# What's in easyb 0.9.7 #

easyb's 0.9.7 release contains the following features and fixes:

  * Keyword `tag` is now supported
    * [behaviors are tag-able now](http://thediscoblog.com/2010/02/23/easyb-will-support-behavior-tagging/); consequently, you can run select tagged behaviors in isolation
  * added new status of 'in review'
    * behaviors can be executed without actually running them; thus, a report is generated with an 'in review' status
  * `shared_behavior` keyword can also be `shared behavior`
    * i.e. the combining underscore is optional
  * keyword `but` implemented -- acts just like `and`
  * Upgraded Groovy dependency to 1.7.2
  * Reporting improvements
  * Numerous Maven 2 plugin fixes
  * easyb download now includes documentation and examples

Plus, there are fixes to the IntelliJ plugin; not to mention we now have an Eclipse plugin! Lastly, there have been various changes to easyb.org.
