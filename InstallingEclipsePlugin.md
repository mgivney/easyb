easyb now has an Eclipse plugin -- this is a work in progress, however, early versions support running easyb stories and specifications and support an Outline view of behaviors. What's more, there is a behavior creation wizard and various templates available in the Eclipse Preferences view. By right clicking on a .story file (or .specification) you can select the **Run As** item, and then you'll see a handy option to run as an easyb story.

Installing the plug-in works as follows:
  1. Go to the **Help** menu and then select **Software Updates...**
  1. Hit the **Add Site..** button and in the resulting dialog, for the location type: `http://easyb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/eclipse-plugins/org.easyb.eclipse.updatesite/`
  1. Hit the **Ok** button
  1. Select the easyb Eclipse Update Site in the list box and then hit the **Install...** button

That's it!
